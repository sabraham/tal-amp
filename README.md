# TAL-AMP
A terminal TAL player

Made at the [2015 TAL Audio Hackathon] (http://audiohackathon.com/).

## Features

* `Episode` - Jump to your favorite episode
* `Random` - Who knows which episode you'll get next??
* `Gray Hair` - Because Death comes to all, even Ira Glass.

Initial episodes feature full black hair,

and as episodes become more recent,

Ira's hair grays appropriately.

## Rationale

* Terminal Apps are FUN
* iTunes and Flash are TERRIBLE
* The ~new web~ often leaves many behind (e.g., the visually-impaired)
